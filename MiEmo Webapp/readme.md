# MiEmo WebApp

## Before you start

Before you start make sure you have the right node version installed on your computer.
if you are on linux **do not install node via apt**, use nvm (node version manager) instead

[nvm-sh](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

## How to start the project ? 

To start this project simply type : 
> yarn 

to download all the nescessary dependencies 

then you can start the developpement server 
> yarn dev 

if you are comming from create-react-app you need to use **yarn dev** instead of **yarn start**

## Conventions

All react files must be in **.jsx format**

You cannot commit if your files is not well formated or have errors.

to format all your code, you need to have the editorconfig and prettier extension enabled.

If you dont have theses extensions or enforce the formatting use 
> yarn format
